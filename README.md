# Car detection using Computer Vision for self-driving cars

At the time of choosing a project for the term we were determined to work on a real-world problem.
One of the most famous news stories this past year was the announcement of the new Tesla semitruck. Along with Tesla comes the idea of self-driving cars, but how do these actually work? How
does a smart car avoid collision with other objects? This is what inspired us to learn more about
self-driving cars. The first step is to design an intelligent system for a car through which it will be
able to identify other cars in a road and this is what we decided we would be a suitable project for
our group.
